# The Bots Frontend coding challenge

For this challenge we would like you to create a [Caeser Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). You will create an input, which will take any string and apply the cipher, then display the results below.

## The Spec

- Create a form which takes a string input, and outputs the string with the cipher applied
- Add a form element to set if the cipher is applied forwards or backwards
- Numbers & special characters should be ignored

## Getting started

- Open a terminal and run \`npm run dev\`
- A second terminal can be opened to run tests: \`npm run test\`

## Considerations

- No libraries please
- Please provide the solution with tests & types
- Expected time should be 1 hour

Please fork this repo and send us a link to your solution. Good luck!
